<h1>Intro to Coronaviruses</h1>
<div id="history" class="section level2">
<h2>History</h2>
<p>I was disappointed to find that coronaviruses have nothing to do with the beer, but instead refer to their appearance. The word “corona” is latin for “crown or garland”, which is how coronaviruses appear under microscopes. However, this does explain why the corona logo has a crown on top of it. Visually, it is more similar to the sun’s corona, which is the outer part of the sun’s atmosphere. There are currently 7 known human coronaviruses.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html">CDC (2020)</a> the 7 coronaviruses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>229E</li>
<li>OC43</li>
<li>NL63</li>
<li>HKU1</li>
<li>SARS-CoV</li>
<li>MERS-CoV</li>
<li>2019 Novel Coronavirus</li>
</ul>
<p>The first human coronaviruses (229E and OC43) were first discovered in the late 1960s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509683/">(Geller, Varbanov, and Duval, 2012)</a>. It wasn’t until the 2003 SARS outbreak that the next one (SARS-CoV) was found. This was followed by NL63 in 2004, and then HKU1 in 2005. Virologists decided to take a break for 7 years, and only discovered the next one (MERS-CoV) due to the MERS outbreak in 2012. That brings us to the current outbreak of Wuhan Virus when the 7th coronavirus (2019 Novel Coronavirus) was discovered. I know “2019 Novel Coronavirus” doesn’t have a great ring to it, but MERS-CoV was actually called “Novel Coronavirus 2012” before it got a final name.</p>

<div id="the-common-coronaviruses" class="section level2">
<h2>The “Common” Coronaviruses</h2>
<p>The first four (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are often associated with the common cold <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html">CDC (2020)</a>, but can lead to more severe complications including pneumonia. According to <a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/jcm/48/8/2940.full.pdf">Gaunt, Hardie, Claas, Simmonds, &amp; Templeton, (2010)</a>, infections are much more common during the winter months and cases drop to almost none during the summer . <a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/jcm/48/8/2940.full.pdf">Guant et. al</a> tested 11,661 sick people between 2006 and 2009 and found 267 (2.3%) tested positive for at least one of these four corona viruses.</p>

<div id="the-outbreak-coronaviruses" class="section level2">
<h2>The “Outbreak” Coronaviruses</h2>
<p>The other three (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV) are much more unique. They represent examples of new viruses that emerge after “jumping” from animals to humans. These viruses are known to infect animals, but a random mutation allows them to suddenly start infecting humans (animal-to-human transmission). An outbreak occurs when an infected person is then able to infect other people (human-to-human transmission). These new viruses are more dangerous for a variety of reasons, but for me the worst aspect is humans have no natural immunity. The rest of this post will focus on the these “outbreak” coronaviruses.</p>

<h1>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)</h1>
<p>The first case of SARS-CoV occured in Guangdong, China in November of 2002 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/history/sars/timeline.htm">WHO, (2013)</a>. However, China did not officially report the infection to the World Health Organization (WHO) until February 11, 2003 <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_21/en/">WHO, (2003)</a>. The WHO issued a global alert on March 12th and reported 150 known cases on March 15th <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_16/en/">(WHO, 2003)</a>. The number of cases had increase to 1,622 by the end of March <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_31/en/">(WHO, 2003)</a>, and balloon to 5,663 by the end of April <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_30a/en/">(WHO, 2003)</a>. On May 22, 2003, the cases crossed the 8,000 mark and had already started to taper off. Finally, on Juy 5, 2003 the WHO declared they had stopped and contained human-to-human transmissions of SARS <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_05/en/">(WHO, 2003)</a>. The total cases came to 8,096 with 774 deaths in 17 countries for a final mortality rate of 9.19%. See the map below for a final count of infections and deaths by country. Eventually it was found that the disease originated in horseshoe bats but went through civets before making the jump to humans. Amazingly, it wasn’t until 2017 that chinese scientists isolated the exact source of SARS to a single cave in the Yunnan province of China <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698">(Hu et al., 2017)</a>.</p>
