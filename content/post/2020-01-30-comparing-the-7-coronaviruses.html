<h1>Intro to Coronaviruses</h1>
<div id="history" class="section level2">
<h2>History</h2>
<p>I was disappointed to find that coronaviruses have nothing to do with the beer, but instead refer to their appearance. The word “corona” is latin for “crown or garland”, which is how coronaviruses appear under microscopes. However, this does explain why the corona logo has a crown on top of it. Visually, it is more similar to the sun’s corona, which is the outer part of the sun’s atmosphere. There are currently 7 known human coronaviruses.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html">CDC (2020)</a> the 7 coronaviruses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>229E</li>
<li>OC43</li>
<li>NL63</li>
<li>HKU1</li>
<li>SARS-CoV</li>
<li>MERS-CoV</li>
<li>2019 Novel Coronavirus</li>
</ul>
<p>The first human coronaviruses (229E and OC43) were discovered in the late 1960s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509683/">(Geller, Varbanov, and Duval, 2012)</a>. It wasn’t until the 2003 SARS outbreak that the next one (SARS-CoV) was found. This was followed by NL63 in 2004, and then HKU1 in 2005. Virologists decided to take a break for 7 years, and only discovered the next one (MERS-CoV) due to the MERS outbreak in 2012. That brings us to the current outbreak of Wuhan Virus when the 7th coronavirus (2019 Novel Coronavirus) was discovered. I know “2019 Novel Coronavirus” doesn’t have a great ring to it, but MERS-CoV was actually called “Novel Coronavirus 2012” before it got a final name.</p>

<h2>The “Common” Coronaviruses</h2>
<p>The first four (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are often associated with the common cold <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html">CDC (2020)</a>, but can lead to more severe complications including pneumonia. According to <a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/jcm/48/8/2940.full.pdf">Gaunt, Hardie, Claas, Simmonds, &amp; Templeton, (2010)</a>, infections are much more common during the winter months and cases drop to almost none during the summer . <a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/jcm/48/8/2940.full.pdf">Guant et. al</a> tested 11,661 sick people between 2006 and 2009 and found 267 (2.3%) tested positive for at least one of these four corona viruses.</p>

<h2>The “Outbreak” Coronaviruses</h2>
<p>The other three (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV) are much more unique. They represent examples of new viruses that emerge after “jumping” from animals to humans. These viruses are known to infect animals, but a random mutation allows them to suddenly start infecting humans (animal-to-human transmission). An outbreak occurs when an infected person is then able to infect other people (human-to-human transmission). These new viruses are more dangerous for a variety of reasons, but for me the worst aspect is humans have no natural immunity. The rest of this post will focus on the these “outbreak” coronaviruses.</p>

<h1>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)</h1>
<p>The first case of SARS-CoV occured in Guangdong, China in November of 2002 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/history/sars/timeline.htm">(WHO, 2013)</a>. However, China did not officially report the infection to the World Health Organization (WHO) until February 11, 2003 <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_21/en/">(WHO, 2003)</a>. The WHO issued a global alert on March 12th and reported 150 known cases on March 15th <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_16/en/">(WHO, 2003)</a>. The number of cases had increase to 1,622 by the end of March <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_31/en/">(WHO, 2003)</a>, and balloon to 5,663 by the end of April <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_30a/en/">(WHO, 2003)</a>. On May 22, 2003, the cases crossed the 8,000 mark and had already started to taper off.</p>
<p>Finally, on Juy 5, 2003 the WHO declared they had stopped and contained human-to-human transmissions of SARS <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_05/en/">(WHO, 2003)</a>. The total cases came to 8,096 with 774 deaths in 17 countries for a final mortality rate of 9.19%. See the map below for a final count of infections and deaths by country. Eventually it was found that the disease originated in horseshoe bats but went through civets before making the jump to humans. It wasn’t until 2017 (14 years later) that chinese scientists isolated the exact source of SARS to a single cave in the Yunnan province of China <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698">(Hu et al., 2017)</a>.</p>

<div id="middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-mers-cov" class="section level1">
<h1>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)</h1>
<p>Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is still active with new infections and deaths being reported. According to the latest update from <a href="http://applications.emro.who.int/docs/EMCSR246E.pdf?ua=1&amp;ua=1">WHO (2019)</a>, there were 5 new cases reported during the month of December, 2019. The total verified cases since 2012 is currently at 2,499 with 861 deaths for a mortality rate of 34.4%. MERS-CoV was first identified during an outbreak in 2012.As its name suggests, most of the infections have orginated and impacted the Middle East with 2,106 cases occuring in Saudi Arabia alone.</p>
<p>It is suspected that Dromedary Camels are a natural reservoir for MERS-CoV, and at least 1 study has found identical infections in a patient and his camels <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896817">(Azhar et al., 2014)</a>. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23933067">Reusken et al. (2013)</a> found that 100% of Omani camels and 14% of Spanish camels in their study had antibodies against MERS-CoV, which means they had the infection at some point in the past. I do want to emphasize that this link is not conclusive, and other animals (including bats) are also suspected carriers. This continued animal-to-human transmission is why MERS-CoV continues to infect people unlike SARS-CoV. It still stands to see whether 2019-nCoV will be one and done like SARS, or will it still be an issue after it is contained like MERS.</p>
<p>While researching MERS I came a really cool publication by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0330-0">Ramshaw et al. (2019)</a>. In order to better understand the geographic distribution of MERS they created a database of geopositioned MERS-CoV infections. This means that it is possible for me to map MERS infections with much better accuracy than the map above. Ramshaw et al. geolocated 882 occurences, but I am going to focus on 402 of their cases. There are two reasons I picked these cases:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>They are all human cases (233 were animal, 3 were environmental)</li>
<li>They have complete longitude and latitude data (244 of the humans were missing this data)</li>
</ol>
<p>This accounts for 16% of the total cases, but Ramshaw et al. do warn that its possible that some cases are duplicates.</p>
