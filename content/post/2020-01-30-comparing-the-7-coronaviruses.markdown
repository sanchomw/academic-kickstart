## Intro to Coronaviruses

As I was doing research for this post I was surprised to find there are only 7 human coronaviruses. According to the CDC (2020) these are: 

* 229E
* NL63
* OC43
* HKU1
* MERS-CoV
* SARS-CoV
* 2019 Novel Coronavirus

The first three (229E, NL63, and OC43) are often associated with the common cold.
